# Davie's Technical Notes

My technical notes of tools I have been using:

* [reStructuredText](restructuredtext/restructuredtext.rst)
* [YAML](yaml/yaml.rst)

Beside these notes, there are complementary projects:

* [Cheatsheets][cheatsheets] - cheatsheets from the notes
* [Books][books] - books as sources for the notes
